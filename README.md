# loopback-hackathon

Welcome to the LoopBack Hackathon! We are finally at the point where we are going to put pen to paper and start making our REST API endpoints with LoopBack.

Your goal: Use the instructions here to create and secure some REST API endpoints. Then create an application that uses these endpoints to do _something_. The nature of that application is completely up to you. The point of a hackathon is for you to create something from the seed idea/prompt you are given.

A few bits of housekeeping before we start:

1. The system will be using and you credentials should have been provided to you in an email. I will also have the URL for the system up on the screen for at least the beginning of the session. Hopefully connecting through SSH should have gone smoothly.

2. I doubt you will be able to finish a complete "solution" that uses your REST APIs within the 2 hours alotted for this Hackathon. I will keep submissions open until Jan 29th. That will give you two weekends if you want to create something really interesting.

3. You can submit your application to me at mirish@ibm. Just tell me where on the system it is running, and how to access it, and I will go check it out. If there are some good submissions, I will write a little email highlighting your effort and ranking the top submissions.

And with that, let's get started!: [Introduction](a.introduction.md)
